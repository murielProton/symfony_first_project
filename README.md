# symfony_first_project
A school project with one associate
We begun our studies in developping this 2 february 2020.
 We found out about Symfony last Friday (March 27th).
 We need to finish on the tenth of April.
 Which gives us about two weeks to solve it. 
Don't forget our school is closed in accord to Covid 19th health policy.
 So we can only communicate by Teams and also thanks to GitHub !
